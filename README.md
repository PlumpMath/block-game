#BlockGame
A C++ OpenGL game that involves blocks.

Setup instructions (Visual Studio 2013):

First, clone this repository to your machine. I have not personally tested this, but I remember reading that you should not
place the project in a location with whitespace in the path.

Then, in Visual Studio, create a new Visual C++ Empty Project, with the correct location and name according to what you did in
the previous step. Be sure to leave the "Create directory for solution" box unchecked.
