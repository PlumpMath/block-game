#BlockGame
A C++ OpenGL game that involves blocks.

Setup instructions (Visual Studio 2013):

First, clone this repository to your machine. I have not personally tested this, but I remember reading that you should not
place the project in a location with whitespace in the path.

Then, in Visual Studio, create a new Visual C++ Empty Project, with the correct location and name according to what you did in
the previous step. Be sure to leave the "Create directory for solution" box unchecked.

Next, download GLEW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.12.0/glew-1.12.0-win32.zip/download) and GLFW
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/files/glfw/3.1.1/glfw-3.1.1.bin.WIN32.zip/download).
